Welcome to our student-run engineering workshop! We build, test, and share small, practical projects (primarily work on and maintain data science projects, web applications, and simple AI solutions)

Core scope
- Domain: data science, machine learning, AI systems, web and cloud services.  
- Level: bachelor / project teams. Practical engineering tasks only.  
- Language: English primary. Polish contributions accepted.

Rules and expectations
- Reproducibility: every repo must include a clear README with exact commands to run the project, a pinned dependency file, and a minimal tests.  
- Time-to-run: examples must be runnable end-to-end within 30 minutes on a standard laptop or using a documented free cloud tier.  
- Deliverables: notebook(s) for EDA/baseline, source code for model or service, Dockerfile (or equivalent), and CI workflow with a smoke test.  
- Licensing: each repo must include a license. No proprietary data in the repository; link to external datasets when required.  
- Contributions: issues for project proposals; PRs for fixes/features. Use small, focused PRs with a descriptive title and tests where applicable.

How to propose a project
- Open an issue titled: Project proposal: <short title>.  
- Provide (1) one-paragraph objective, (2) dataset link, (3) 2–3 concrete deliverables, and (4) required runtimes/tools.

Maintainers’ obligations
- Keep examples minimal and deterministic. Pin versions. Fix build breaks promptly. Merge only when CI passes. Close stale PRs within two weeks unless actively maintained.
